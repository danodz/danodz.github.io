                    Back when I was studying nutrition, we used the canadian nutrient file (fcen is for the french name "Fichier canadien des éléments nutritifs").
                    The software we used in class also got it's data from the file, but I found it annoying to use so I made this.
                    The database isn't that big, so I downloaded and reformated it to a json file fitting my needs.
                    That way I don't need a db, it's a single file and runs offline.

                <p>
                    You can try it out here. The data is provided by health canada and is up to date as of march 16th 2020. There is a helper page, but it's in french:
                    <a href="fcen/">Fcen Interface</a>
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    You can check out the source here. There is a bit of experimental and exploratory code in there, the whole project was made with the intent of being enventually remade bigger and better:
                    <a href="https://github.com/danodz/fcenSearch">Fcen search on github</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on this, I started a bigger project called FOOD to actually use the data found in the fcen, not just search it. You can find it here:
                    <a href="https://github.com/danodz/FOOD">FOOD</a>
